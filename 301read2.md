# Read 2: State and Props

### React Lifecycle:

- **what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**

   after the component is rendered correctly, componentDidMount() function is called and that call getData() function.

- **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React ?**

   static getDerivedStateFromProps() This is the first method that gets called in the updating lifecycle phase.

- **React lifecycle methods in order :**

  - getDerivedStateFromProps()
  - shouldComponentUpdate()
  - render()
  - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
  - componentDidUpdate()


### React State vs Props:
- **What types of things can you pass in the props?**

    any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc.

- **What is the big difference between props and state?**

    The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.

- **When do we re-render our application?**

    React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props
