## I will talk about two main things in this Front-End Development (HTML & CSS)

There many thing everyone should learn to build and design a good,dynamic and beautiful web pages Understanding HTML and CSS
can help anyone who works
with the web; designers can
create more attractive and
usable sites, website editors can
create better content.


***HTML:***
The ** HyperText Markup Language**, or **HTML** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as ** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) ** and scripting languages such as ** JavaScript (JS)**.


***CSS:*** **Cascading Style Sheets** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as ** HTML. CSS**  is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and ** JavaScript**. 

**Presentation:** How to control
things like the color of text, the
fonts you want to use and the
size of those fonts, how to add
background colors to pages (or
parts of a page), and how to add
background images.

**Layout:** How to control where
the different elements are
positioned on the screen. You
will also learn several techniques
that professionals use to make
their pages more attractive.

## The Structure of HTML :
The **HTML** file is considered  as a document file written in a markup language each document must have a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long
piece, there may be subheadings
that split the story into separate the
sections. This Structure help viewers to understand what this web page is talking about.

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets â€” these are called HTML elements.
***example:***

**<html>**

    <head>  

      <title> web page title </title>
     

    </head>

    <body>  

      <h1></h1>
      <h2></h2>
      <p></p>
      <a></a>

    </body>

**</html>**

** (the web page title will show up in the browser tap)**

the **<head>** tag takes other specific tags for linking files (css files and js files).

the **<body>** tag (the body of the document) will hold the page content and present them.

 Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.


Each tag can hold many attributes that can effect the way the element will appear on the web page.

***example:***

** <p lang="en-us"> Paragraph in English </p> **
the **<p>** tag reprecents a paragraph that holds multiline text inside of it and has an attribute called ** lang** (for language) and has a value on the right hand side of the equal  sign.

## Extra Markup: 

### 1- DOCTYPEs:
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML

for **HTML5** we use  **<!DOCTYPE html>**


### 2- Comments in HTML:
all developers write down comments to help them/other understand the code after coming back to it later or to explain something in details, or to disable an unwanted block of code.

to write down a comment in HTML we use these symbols:

**<!-- anything between these symbols wont show up on the web page -->**


there are many other attribues that can be used  like (**ID attribue , Class attribute , Block attribute , Inline attribute ..... etc**).


## Process & Design:

Each site will be different from one website to another depending on the target audience.
The developers must talk with the clients about their website idea in order to collect specific information(Requirements) to build the desired project and create a specific scope.
