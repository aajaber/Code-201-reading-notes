# Read 5:  Putting it all together

- **How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?**

      draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names

- **What is the (single responsibility principle) and how does it apply to components?**

    - single responsibility principle: 

          (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.

    - how does it apply to components:

          In React, the Single Responsibility Principle means that a component is required to have only one reason to change. In short, the Single Responsibility Principle means that code with the same functionality should not exist in multiple places.

- ** What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application ?** 

          Static applications and websites render in the user's browser without the need for server side processing, this means that all the rendering of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is done on the client side, rather then relying on server side technologies

- **Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?** 


      Link to the static app to  GitHub (or supported version-control tool of choice) 



- ** What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? **

          not sure.



- **How can you identify where state needs to live?**
