## Functional Programming Concepts:

- **What is functional programming?**

    - **Functional Programming** :
    
     functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

- **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

    - **Pure Function:** 
    is a function that has the following properties: The function return values are identical for identical arguments. The function application has no side effects. Thus a pure function is a computational analogue of a mathematical function



- **What are the benefits of a pure function?**

      pure function is immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments


- **What is immutability?**

      In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object, which can be modified after it is

- **What is Referential transparency?**

  used in functional programming, means that given a function and an input value, you will always receive the same output.




  ## Node JS - Modules and require():


- **What is a module?**

       A module is a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines. One or more independently developed modules make up a program.

- **What does the word ‘require’ do?**

      The basic functionality of require is that it reads a JavaScript file, executes the file, and then proceeds to return the exports object

- **How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

    **EX:**
    
    var VAR-NAME = require("MODULE-NAME");


- **What do we have to do to make a module available?**
