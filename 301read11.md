## Mongo and Mongoose:

#### - Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
| SQL     | NoSQL |
|---------|-------|
|SQL databases are relational|NoSQL databases are non-relational.|
|SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema.|NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.|
|SQL databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.|
|SQL databases are table-based|NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.|
|SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions|NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.|



- **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

    - Numeric data types such as int, tinyint, bigint, float, real, etc.
    - Date and Time data types such as Date, Time, Datetime, etc.
    - Character and String data types such as char, varchar, text, etc.
    - Unicode character string data types, for example nchar, nvarchar, ntext, etc.
    - Binary data types such as binary, varbinary, etc.

- **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

    - column-oriented
    - document-oriented
    - key-value pairs
    - graph databases.

- **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

      Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry

- **Which type of database is best for scalability?**

      not sure , but multiple database type use is the combination of MySQL and MongoDB.




- **What does SQL stand for?**

      Structured Query Language

- **What is a realational database?**

      A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

- **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

      
      A relational database consists of a collection of tables,
      each having a unique name.

- **What is a ‘schema’?**

     is an abstract design that represents 
     the storage of a data in a database


- **What is a NoSQL database?**

      NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables

- **How does it work?**


     it provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.


- **What is inside of a Mongo database?**


     MongoDB stores data records as documents
