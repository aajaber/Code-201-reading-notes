## Authentication:

- **What is OAuth?**

      is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.


- **Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.**

      when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon

- **How does OAuth work ,What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
?**

       Let’s assume a user has already signed into one website or service (OAuth only works using HTTPS). The user then initiates a feature/transaction that needs to access another unrelated site or service.


- **What is OpenID?**

      n open authentication protocol that profiles and extends OAuth 2.0 to add an identity layer.



##  Authorization and Authentication flows:

- **What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**

    - authorization: giving permission to use a service or a resource.

    - authentication: in software it means providing the correct/right values to gain authorization. (like username and password) (the process of checking wither data is correct or not)


- **What is Authorization Code Flow?**

      Authorization code flow is used to obtain an access token to authorize API requests.

- **What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**

      OpenId Connect flow specifically designed to authenticate native or mobile application users
- **What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

- **What is Client Credentials Flow?**

- **What is Device Authorization Flow?**

- **What is Resource Owner Password Flow?**
